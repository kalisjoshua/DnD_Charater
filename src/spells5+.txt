Explanation/Description: This spell is used by the cleric to remove the onus of unwilling or unknown deeds from the person who is the subject of the atonement. The spell will remove the effects of magical alignment change as well. The person for whom atonement is being made must be either truly repentant or not in command of his or her own will so as to be able to be repentant. Your referee will judge this spell in this regard, noting any past instances of its use upon the person. Deliberate misdeeds and acts of knowing and willful nature cannot be atoned for with this spell.

Explanation/Description: By use of a commune spell the cleric is able to contact his or her divinity - or agents thereof - and request information in the form of questions which can be answered by a simple "yes" or "no". The cleric is allowed one such question for every level of experience he or she has attained. The answers given will be correct. It is probable that the referee will limit the use of commune spells to one per adventure, one per week, or even one per month, for the "gods" dislike frequent interruptions. The material components necessary to a commune spell are the cleric's religious symbol, holy/unholy water, and incense.

Explanation/Description: The cure critical wounds spell is a very potent version of the cure light wounds spell (9.v.). The cleric lays his ar her hand upon a creature and heals from 6 to 27 (3d 8+3) hit points of damage from wounds or other damage.

If any creature is within the area of effect of a flame strike, it must make a saving throw. Failure to make the save means the creature has sustained 6-48 (6d8) hit points of damage; otherwise, 3-24 (3d8) hit points of damage are taken.

Player's Handbook
Explanation/Description: When this spell is cast by the cleric, a horde of creeping, hopping, and flying insects swarm in a thick cloud. These insects obscure vision, limiting it to 3". Creatures within the insect plague sustain 1 hit point of damage for each melee round they remain in it due to the bites and stings of the insects, regardless of armor class. The referee will cause all creatures with fewer than five hit dice to check morale. Creatures with two or fewer hit dice will automatically move-at their fastest possible speed in a straight line in a random direction until they are not less than 24" distant from the cloud of insects. Creatures with fewer than five hit dice which fail their morale check will behave likewise. Heavy smoke will drive off insects within its bounds. Fire will also drive insects away; a wall of fire in a ring shape will keep the insect plague outside its confines, but a fire ball will simply clear insects from its blast area for 1 turn. Lightning and cold/ice act likewise. The plague lasts for 1 turn for each level of experience of the cleric casting the spell, and thereafter the insects disperse. The insects swarm in an area which centers around a summoning point determined by the spell caster, which point can be up to 36" distant from the cleric. The insect plague does not move thereafter for as long as it lasts. Note that the spell can be countered by casting a dispel magic upon the summoning point. A cube of force (a special magic item) would keep insects away from a character seeking the center of the swarm, but invisibility would afford no protection. The material components of this spell are a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat.

The recipient of the spell will remain in the new plane until sent forth by some like means. If several persons link hands in a circle, up to seven can be affected by the plane shift at the same time. The material component of this spell is o small, forked metal rod - the exact size and metal type dictating to which plane of existence the spell will send the affected creature(s) to. (Your referee will determine specifics regarding how and what planes are reached.) An unwilling victim must be touched in order to be sent thusly; and in addition, the creature also is allowed a saving throw, and if the latter is successful the effect of the spell is negated.

Player's Handbook
Explanation/Description: The quest is a spell by means of which the cleric requires the affected creature to perform a service and return to the cleric with proof that the deed was accomplished. The quest can, for example, require the location and return of some important or valuable object, the rescue of a notable person, the release of some creature, the capture of a stronghold, the slaying of a person, the delivery of some item, and so forth. If the quest is not properly followed due to disregard, delay, or perversion, the creature affected by the spell loses 1 from its saving throw dice far each day of such action, and this penalty will not be removed until the quest is properly discharged or the cleric cancels it. (There are certain circumstances which will temporarily suspend a quest, and other which will discharge or cancel it; your Dungeon Master will give you appropriate information as h e need to know arises.) The material component of this spell is the cleric's religious symbol.

Player's Handbook
Explanation/Description: When the cleric casts a raise dead spell, he or she can restore life to a dwarf, gnome, half-elf, halfling, or human. The length of time which the person has been dead is of importance, as the cleric can raise dead persons only up to a certain point, the limit being 1 day for each level of experience of the cleric, i.e. a 9th level cleric can raise a person dead for up to 9 days. Note that the body of the person must be whole, or otherwise missing parts will still be missing when the person is brought back to life. Also, the resurrected person must make a special saving throw to survive the ordeal (see CHARACTER ABILITITIES. Constitution). Furthermore, the raised person is weak and helpless in any event, and he or she will need one full day of rest in bed for each day he or she was dead. The somatic component of the spell is a pointed finger. The reverse of the spell, slay living, allows the victim a saving throw, and if it is successful, the victim sustains damage equal only to that caused by a cause serious wounds spell, i.e. 3-17 hit points. An evil cleric can freely use the reverse spell; a good cleric must exercise extreme caution in its employment, being absolutely certain that the victim of the Slay Living spell is evil and that his or her death is a matter of great necessity and for good, otherwise the alignment of the cleric will be sharply changed. Note that newly made undead, excluding skeletons, which fall within the days of being dead limit are affected by raise dead spells cast upon them. The effect of the spell is to cause them to become resurrected dead, providing the constitution permits survival; otherwise, they are simply dead.

The exact location of displaced things is obvious. Invisible things and those which are astral or ethereal become quite visible. Illusions and apparitions are seen through. Polymorphed, changed, or magic’ed things are apparent. Even the aura projected by creatures becomes visible, so that the cleric is able to know whether they are good or evil or between. The spell requires an ointment for the eyes. The ointment is made from very rare mushroom powder, saffron, and fat. The reverse of the spell, false seeing, causes the person to see things as they are not, rich being poor, rough smooth, beautiful ugly. The ointment for the reverse spell is concocted of oil, poppy dust, and pink orchid essence. For both spells, the ointment must be aged for 1-6 months.

Player's Handbook
Explanation/Description: This spell summons an invisible aerial servant (see ADVANCED DUNGEONS 8 DRAGONS, MONSTER MANUAL) to do the bidding of the cleric who conjured it. The creature does not fight, but it obeys the command of the cleric with respect to finding and returning with whatever object or creature that is described to it. Of course, the object or creature must be such as to allow the aerial servant to physically bring it to the cleric or his or her assign. The spell caster should keep in mind the consequences of having an aerial servant prevented, for any reason, from completion of the assigned duty. The spell lasts for a maximum of 1 day for each level of experience of the cleric who cast it. The aerial servant returns to its own plane whenever the spell lapses, its duty is fulfilled, it is dispelled, the cleric releases it, or the cleric is slain. The cleric must have a protection from evil spell, or be within a magic circle, thaumaturgic triangle, or pentagram when summoning an aerial servant unless the cleric has his or her religious symbol or a religious artifact or relic to use to control the creature. Otherwise, the creature will slay its summoner and return from whence it came. The aerial servant will always attack by complete surprise when sent on a mission, and gain the benefit of 4 free melee rounds unless the creature involved is able to detect invisible objects in which case a six-sided die is rolled, and 1 = 1 free round, 2 = 2 free rounds, 3 = 3 free rounds, 4 = 4 free rounds, and 5 or 6 = 0 free rounds (the opponent is not surprised at all). Each round the aerial servant must dice to score a hit, and when a hit is scored, it means the aerial servant has grabbed the item or creature it was sent to take and bring back to the cleric. If a creature is involved, the aerial servant's strength is compared to the strength of the creature to be brought. If the creature in question does not have a strength rating, roll the appropriate number of the correct type of hit dice for the aerial servant and for the creature it has grabbed. The higher total is the stronger.

1 cubic foot/Lv
Player's Handbook
Explanation/Description: This powerful spell enables the cleric casting it to imbue inanimate objects with mobility and o semblance of life. The animated object, or objects, then attack whomever or whatever the cleric first designates. The object can be of any material whatsoever - wood, metal, stone, fabric, leather, ceramic, glass, etc. The speed of movement of the object is dependent upon its means of propulsion and its weight. A large wooden table would be rather heavy, but its legs would give it speed. A rug could only slither along. A jar would roll. Thus a large stone pedestal would rock forward at 1" per round, a stone statue would move at 4" per round, a wooden statue 8 ' per round, on ivory stool of light weight would move at 12". Slithering movement is about 1" to 2" per round, rolling 3" to 6" per round. The damage caused by the attack of an animated object is dependent upon its form and composition. Light, supple objects can only obscure vision, obstruct movement, bind, trip, smother, etc. Light, hard objects con fall upon or otherwise strike for 1-2 hit points of damage or possibly obstruct and trip as do light, supple objects. Hard, medium weight objects con crush or strike for 2-8 hit points of damage, those larger and heavier doing 3-12, 4-16, or even 5-20 hit points of damage. The frequency of attack of animated objects is dependent upon their method of locomotion, appendages, and method of attack. This varies from as seldom as once every five melee rounds to as frequently as once per melee round. The armor class of the object animated is basically a function of material and movement ability with regard to hitting. Damage is dependent upon the type of weapon and the object struck. A sharp cutting weapon is effective against fabric, leather, wood and like substances. Heavy smashing and crushing weapons are useful against wood, stone, and metal objects. Your referee will determine all of these factors, as well as how much damage the animated object can sustain before being destroyed. The cleric can animate 1 cubic foot of material for each level of experience he or she has attained. Thus, a 14th level cleric could animate one or more objects whose solid volume did not exceed 14 cubic feet, i.e. o large statue, two rugs, three chairs, or a dozen average crocks.

The barrier remains for 3 melee rounds for every level of experience of the cleric casting it.

The conjured animal(s) remain in the cleric's locale for 2 melee rounds for each level of experience of the cleric conjuring it (them), or until slain. The spell caster can, by means of his incantation, call up one or more mammals with hit dice whose total does not exceed his or her level. Thus, a cleric of 12th level could conjure one mammal with 12 hit dice, two with 6 hit dice each, three with 4 hit dice each, 4 with 3 hit dice each, six with 2 hit dice each, or 12 with 1 hit die each. For every + 1 (hit point) of a creature's hit dice, count 1/4 of a hit die, i.e. a creature with 4 +3 hit dice equals a 4 3/4 hit dice creature. The creature(s) summoned by the spell will unfailingly attack the opponent(s) of the cleric by whom the spell was cast.

The spell will enable the cleric to select the correct direction which will eventually lead him or her to egress, the exact path to follow (or actions to take), and this knowledge will persist as long as the spell lasts, i.e. 1 turn for each level of experience of the cleric casting find the path. The spell frees the cleric, and those with him or her from a maze spell in a single melee round and will continue to do so as long as the spell lasts. The material component of this spell is a set of divination counters of the sort favored by the cleric - bones, ivory counters, sticks, carved runes, or whatever.

Player's Handbook
Explanation/Description: By means of the astral spell a cleric is able to project his or her astral body into the Astral Plane, leaving his or her physical body and material possessions behind on the Prime Material Plane, (the plane on which the entire universe and all of its parallels have existence). Only certain magic items which have multi-planed existence can be brought into the Astral Plane. As the Astral Plane touches upon all of the first levels of the Outer Planes, the cleric can travel astrally to any of these Outer Planes as he or she wills. The cleric then leaves the Astral Plane, forming a body on the plane of existence he or she .has chosen to enter. It is also possible to travel astrally anywhere in the Prime Material Plane by means of the astral spell, but a second body cannot be formed on the Prime Material Plane. As a general rule, a person astrally projected con be seen only by creatures on the Astral Plane. At all times the astral body is connected to the material by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken, the affected person is killed, astrally and materially, but generally only the psychic wind can normally cause the cord to break. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the new body, and the cord simply returns to the latter where it rests on the Prime Material Plane, reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although astrally projected persons are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions do not affect creatures not existing on the Astral Plane. The spell lasts until the cleric desires to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means (dispel magic or destruction of the cleric’s body on the Prime Material Plane). The cleric can take up to five other creatures with him or her by means of the astral spell, providing the creatures are linked in a circle with the cleric. These fellow travelers are dependent upon the cleric and can be stranded. Travel in the Astral Plane con be slow or fast according to the cleric‘s desire. The ultimate destination arrived at is subject to the conceptualization of the cleric. (See APPENDIX IV, THE KNOWN PLANES OF EXISTENCE, for further information on the Astral Plane and astral projection.)

The control weather spell will not radically change the temperature, i.e. from below zero to a 100 degree temperature heat wave.

When casting the spell, the cleric must name the demon, devil, demi-god, god, or similar being he or she desires to make use of the gate and come to the cleric's aid. There is a 100% certainty that something will step through the gate. The actions of the being which comes through will depend on many factors, including the alignment of the cleric, the nature of those in company with him or her, and who or what opposes or threatens the cleric. Your Dungeon Master will have a sure method of dealing with the variables of the situation. The being gated in will either return immediately (very unlikely) or remain to take action.

Explanation/Description: When this spell is cast, the life energy level of the recipient creature is raised upwards by one. This subsumes previous life energy level drain of the creature by some force or monster. Thus, if a 10th level character had been struck by a wight and drained to 9th level, the restoration spell would bring the character up to exactly the number of experience points necessary to restore him or her to 10th level once again, and restoring additional hit dice (or hit points) and level functions accordingly. Restoration is only effective if the spell is cast within 1 day/level of experience of the cleric casting it of the recipient's loss of life energy. The reverse, energy drain, draws away a life energy level (cf. such "undead" as spectre, wight, vampire). The energy drain requires the victim to be touched.
